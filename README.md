This repository contains the code for a Data Pipeline that integrates real-time data from IoT sensors and the AccuWeather API to optimize irrigation management. It uses MQTT, Azure Data Lake, and Apache Spark to automate ETL processes, enabling efficient data analysis and irrigation optimization in real-time.

Smart Irrigation Data Pipeline with IoT Sensors and Weather API Integration
This repository contains the code and implementation for a Data Pipeline designed to optimize irrigation management through real-time data integration from IoT sensors and the AccuWeather API. The project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data into a scalable cloud infrastructure, making it ready for analysis and predictive modeling.

Key Features:
IoT Sensor Integration: Real-time data collection from sensors measuring temperature, humidity, and solar radiation using MQTT.
Weather API Integration: Integration with AccuWeather API for periodic weather forecasts to enhance irrigation decision-making.
ETL Pipeline: Efficient extraction, transformation, and loading of data into Azure Data Lake using Apache Spark and Databricks for processing and analysis.
Automated Irrigation Optimization: Leverages real-time and forecast data to optimize irrigation schedules, reducing water waste and improving resource efficiency.
Scalability and Extensibility: Designed to handle increasing data loads from additional sensors and sources in the future.
This project is part of a Masterâ€™s Thesis focused on building a robust ETL pipeline for real-time data processing and decision-making in precision agriculture.
